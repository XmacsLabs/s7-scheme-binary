# S7 Scheme Binary
## Installation
On windows, just download it and rename it to `s7.exe`.

On Linux/macOS, we suggest that you should download the binary to `$HOME/bin/s7`.

Here are sample command lines to install the S7 binary on macOS arm64:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
wget https://github.com/XmacsLabs/s7-scheme-binary/releases/download/v20230413.0/s7_macosx_arm64 -O $HOME/bin/s7
chmod +x $HOME/bin/s7
```

## Versioning
For example, `v20230413.0` means we are using the S7 scheme on 2023/04/13. And `0` identifies the packager script version.
